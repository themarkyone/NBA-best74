//
// When we talk about sports, one thing that most people would do 
// is to argue who is the best player in the field. 
// 
// It is easier to compare players in the same era, by comparing 
// their statistics, total championship and performance against 
// each other. However, it is not easy to compare players from 
// different eras in the history, since they usually played 
// against different competitors, and the relative performance 
// is subjective. Overall, there is no universal standard. 
// 
// NBA, as the most famous basketball league in the world, 
// playing one of the most popular sport globally, would never 
// lack this kind of discussion. 
// 
// Who is the best NBA player of all time? LeBron James or Michael 
// Jordan? Who is the best Center of all time? Bill Russell or 
// Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? Players from which era are better? The 
// 1980s - 1990s or the 2010s? 
// 
// In 2020, ESPN experts considered players' career value and peak 
// performance, and they went through thousands of head to head 
// matchups. They eventually gave out a rank list with 74 greatest
// NBA players in the 74-year history of NBA. 
// 
// This website is a gallery of the EPSN ranking, include the 
// ranking, ESPN expert's ranking reason, career stats, and peak 
// performance for every individual player.
